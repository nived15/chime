PART-1:
=====
The idea is to make this website as a template to be used by district authorities.

District authorities have data like:
  - how many infected in their district
  - how many hospitals are there in their district
  - capacity of each hospital

Giving this template to all district authorities enables them to get a a very precise prediction on: 
  - how much time does an average infected person remain in hospital
  - how much time {days} would it take before their hospitals have exhausted all their resources.
  - If COVID numbers in their district is coming down by social distancing
  - If proper action not taken, then in how many days will this number double
  - If action taken properly, how many days to recover
  - How much time does an average infected person remain in ICU/Ventilator



PART-2:
=====
Step-1: Remove the manual input provided by Hospital by collecting the data automatically { where ever possible }

Step-2: Collect covid-19 real time data: { twice per day basis}
		How many infected?
		How many cured?
		How many severe?

Step-3: Create a template which can be passed to all ostpital admins
